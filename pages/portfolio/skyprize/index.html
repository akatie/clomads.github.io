            <h2>Can we do it better?</h2>
            <p>Silkroute wanted to improve the design and user experience of using digital coupons while offering the solution as a white-label solution for brands to provide the service to their customers or employees. Our initial ideation took us to thinking about the userâ€™s want to find something near them and search through as many options as possible.<br><br></p>

            <h2>Early navigation concepts.</h2>
            <p>Our initial efforts focused on a single vendor as our client and I focused my initial visual interaction design based on their branding conventions. These menus were two thought processes I had to make interacting with the menu more fun while placing emphasis on search. While these concepts are definitely white-lableable, they didn't fit in the MVP development path, so we moved forward with a basic bottom tab navigation.</p>

            <p>Silkroute's main goal was to allow for brands to offer the SkyPrize service to their customers, employees, clients, etc. Thinking of ways to simplify the interface to allow for multiple branding opportunities, the design and code were made to be modular. Changing a few variables like color palatte, typography, and logo bring this example for Dupont into the corporate world. <br><br><strong>Slide the slider to see the difference.</strong> <br><br></p>
